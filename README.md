Woofing Walks is a dog walking service based in the Rhondda Valleys. The aim of the website is to promote Woofing Walks' services and attract new customers to the business. Woofing Walks is aimed at dog owners looking for trusted dog walkers in their local area. 
The website provides information of what new customers can expect from their services. It also includes walk times, prices & contact information.

## **Wireframes**
### **Home Page**
<details><summary>Mobile</summary>

![Mobile](docs/supp-images/wf-index-mobile.webp)
</details>

<details><summary>Desktop</summary>

![Desktop](docs/supp-images/wf-index.webp)
</details>

The Homepage design stayed the same, with the addition of a page title that displays underneath the hero image on mobile devices and as an overlay on larger screens. The title tells the user instantly what the website is and where the services are offered.

### **About Page**
<details><summary>Mobile</summary>

![Mobile](docs/supp-images/wf-about-mobile.webp)
</details>

<details><summary>Desktop</summary>

![Desktop](docs/supp-images/wf-about.webp)
</details>

The "Why choose us?" section was changed to "Our Mission". I didn't want two lists at the bottom of the about page. The "How it works" sections made more sense as it explains the next steps clearly to potential new customers.

### **Contact Page**
<details><summary>Mobile</summary>

![Mobile](docs/supp-images/wf-signup-mobile.webp)
</details>

<details><summary>Desktop</summary>

![Desktop](docs/supp-images/wf-signup.webp)
</details>

The contact details were moved to the top of the page to ensure that they're found easily. The option to sign up for a newsletter didn't quite coincide with the need to attract new business. Having a simple online form to capture basic details of the customer and their dog is a much more effective way to onboard new customers.

# **Testing**

## **Responsiveness**

## **Browser Compatibility**

## **Solved Bugs**
1. Footer cuts off bottom content on mobile devices in chrome browser. Content cut off fixed by switching from fixed-bottom to sticky-bottom. 

2. W3C validator showed error with nav buttons including a tags. I fixed this by removing the button tag, adding a button class and styling the button using CSS. Fixing this error affected my "more info" button in my hero image section. This was easily fixed by adding the button class previously used.

3. Whitespace showing to the right of index page. I used Chrome dev tools and found that the bootstrap row class was adding unwanted gutter. I removed this by using g-0 class alongside the row class.

4. Contact Form page has whitespace to the right. Using dev tools, I could see that one of my row divs was causing the issue, but wasn't sure which one. I added background-color: red to one div and background-color: blue to another to identify. I then added margin:auto to the problem div in CSS.

![contact-bug-4](docs/supp-images/contact-bug-4.webp)


5. Nav buttons are showing too large on medium screens (768px) on the Index Page and Contact Page. Bug fixed by removing larger font size in the 768px media query.

6. Image in the Our Story section distorted. Changed the original image to square, using windows. Coverted the image to Webp and replaced existing image to fix the bug.

7. Overlay is floating upwards when changing screen sizes for larger screens. Issue was fixed by adding bottom:0 to cta-container, it now sits flush to the bottom of the hero image.

![overlay-bug-7](docs/supp-images/overlay-bug-7.webp)

8. Fixing the overlay bug caused the container to be in a fixed position on mobile and tablet devices. Dev tools was used to find the declaration causing the issue, position:fixed. By removing this the bug is fixed and the container sits directly beneath the hero image as intended.

![container-bug-8](docs/supp-images/container-bug-8.webp)

9. Contact form showed 405 error page when submitted. Bug fixed by removing method="POST" attribute from form tag.
